            <p> Climate change (also known as global warming) refers to the documented century scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system, as well as the associated repercussions. Scientists are more than 95% positive that growing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other human-caused emissions are to blame for substantially all of global warming.

                <p> Long-term changes in temperature and weather patterns are referred to as climate change. These movements may be natural, but human activity have been the primary cause of climate change since the 1800s, mostly owing to the combustion of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and gas), which creates heat-trapping gases.
