            <p>Stop Cutting down Trees: Believe it or not, cutting down trees is the prime reason of the climate change. Shockingly, every year 33 million acres of forests are cut down.

Planting new trees will quickly reduce the rate of emission of gases. Moreover, you can get used furniture instead of buying new one.
