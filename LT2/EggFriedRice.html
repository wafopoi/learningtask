    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
<ul>
    <li> <p>Rice    (as    much    as    you    fancy    really!)    </p> </li>
    <li> <p>Half    an    onion    (Or    more,    again    if    you    fancy    it)    </p> </li>
    <li> <p>A    tin    of    sweetcorn</p> </li>
    <li> <p>A    few    mushrooms  </p> </li>
    <li> <p>1 to 2    eggs    </p> </li>
</ul>
    <h2> Method </h2>
    <ol>
    <li> <p> Start    cooking    the    rice    however    you    do,    and    put    some    oil    in    a    frying    pan.    </p> </li>
    <li> <p> Chop    the    onion    into    bits,    any    size    really,    doesnt    matter    particularly    and    throw    
into    the    frying    pan.    </p> </li>
    <li> <p>Chop    the    mushrooms    and    add    to    the    onions.        </p> </li>
    <li> <p> Once    the    rice    is    cooked,    drain    it    off    and    add    it    into    the    frying    pan.       </p> </li>
    <li> <p> Tip    the    drained    sweetcorn    into    the    pan    as    well    and    stir    it    all    up.        </p> </li>
    <li> <p> Break    the    eggs    into    the    pan    (OR    beat    them    together    in    another    bowl    and    tip    
into    the    frying    pan)    and    stir    the    mixture    up.        </p> </li>
    <li> <p> At    this    point,    you    need    to    keep    stirring    the    mixture,    keeping    the    eggs    moving.    
Keep    going    until    the    eggs    have    cooked,    should    take    about    5 to 8    minutes    maybe?    </p> </li>
</ol>
